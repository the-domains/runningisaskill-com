  1. Stand tall, don't lean. The Pose lean is accurate however as a coaching cue
  makes most runners worse. The Chi hip wiggle, unless explained to me
  incorrectly, relates to a walking gait, not running.

![Here are some pearls of wisdom on technique. Respect to Gordon Pirie](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/77548622-6492-4fe9-bc0f-fd5249e3f423.jpg)

1\. Stand tall, don't lean. The Pose lean is accurate however as a coaching cue makes most runners worse. The Chi hip wiggle, unless explained to me incorrectly, relates to a walking gait, not running.

2\. Quick rhythm. At least 3 strides per second, 180 strides per minute. This is crucial advice for all runners.

3\. Breathe easy, take deep diaphragmatic breaths. Learn to breathe.

4\. Don't heel strike. Flat footed landing. If anyone is confused by this get in touch.

5\. Smile High!

Get coached! See through the bollocks forever. Wisdom, knowledge, victory. Help@runningisaskill.com

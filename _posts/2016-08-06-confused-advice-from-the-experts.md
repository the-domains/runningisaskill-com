# Confused advice from the 'experts'.

To clarify:

1\. Stand tall, don't lean. Pose lean is accurate however as a coaching cue makes most runners worse. The Chi hip wiggle is inaccurate and relates to a walking gait, not running.

2\. At least 3 strides per second. Never heel strike. The human heel's job is to tell our proprioceptive system at what speed to stop heel striking and to start forefoot striking. It's about 4mph whoever you are and wherever you are from. This being said, forefoot good, heel strike bad is over simplified. A flat foot landing is the goal. Conditioned feet and skilful running technique are prerequisites.

3\. Breathe easy, take deep diaphragmatic breaths. Agree with them on this however you need to learn it.

Smile High!

Get coached by me. See through the bollocks forever! Wisdom, knowledge, victory.

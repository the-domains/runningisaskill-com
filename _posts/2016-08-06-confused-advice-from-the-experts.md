# Confused advice from the 'experts'.

To clarify:

1\. Stand tall, don't lean. The Pose lean is accurate however as a coaching cue makes most runners worse. The Chi hip wiggle is inaccurate and relates to a walking gait, not running.

2\. Quick rhythm. At least 3 strides per second, 180 strides per minute. This is the no. 1 piece of advice for all runners. 

3\. Breathe easy, take deep diaphragmatic breaths. Agree with them on this however you need to be coached to learn how.

4\. Don't heel strike. Flat footed landing. If anyone is confused by this get in touch.

5\. Smile High!

Get coached by me. See through the bollocks forever. Wisdom, knowledge, victory.
